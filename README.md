## Coffee Defense Game

### Disclaimer

This is a game I did while in University a long time ago. Thought I'd put it on GitHub for giggles.

### Instructions

Your task is to save the globe from the disappearance of the coffee by destroying the beetles before they reach the finish line. Destruction takes place by building obstacles and weapons on the path of the beetles. Construction costs money, you have some money when you start the game,but you get more when you destroy the beetles.

When you think you are ready to start the game, press the START button to send your first wave of beetles.

The beetles appear in waves, each wave is more challenging than the previous one. Below the game area, you will see in seconds when the next wave will come, so you can prepare for it.

There are five different levels of beetles, each level has its own color. Higher-level beetles move faster and withstand more hits than lower-level beetles. Similarly, you can "upgrade" your weapons for money by clicking on an item on the game board and then clicking the UPGRADE button in the Inventory menu. Next to the UPGRADE button is a SELL button to remove an item from the game board and get your money back.

If the beetles pass through the playing area, the "Coffee left" reading will decrease. If the count goes to zero, you lose the game. If you survive the last wave with coffee left, you win the game. The game is then reset and you can start a new game directly.
